## [From Numbers to Insights: Applying Linear Algebra Techniques to the Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/MohammedISMAILI/boston-housing-linear-algebra)
**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear Regression, PCA

This project explores the application of linear algebra techniques, specifically matrix operations and vector computations, to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. By developing a linear regression model, enriched with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis, the project demonstrates how these mathematical techniques can provide valuable insights into the real estate market.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and normalization for optimal model performance.
- Feature selection based on correlation matrices and eigenvalue analysis.
- Implementation of linear regression to predict housing prices.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA for enhanced model interpretability.
- Visualization of data and results through scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts.
